## Key Findings

### 1. Regional Genre Preferences
- **North America**: Action, Sports, and Shooter genres dominate the market
- **Japan**: Role-Playing games significantly outperform other genres
- **Europe**: Shows preferences closer to North America but with some variation

### 2. Platform Lifecycle Patterns

- PS3 showed peak sales around 2011-2012, followed by decline as PS4 emerged
- Timing game releases to align with platform growth phases maximizes exposure

### 3. Publisher Performance

For maximum market reach, develop an **Action-RPG hybrid** that combines:
- Action elements to appeal to North American preferences

### Regional Market Strategy
1. **For Japan**: Emphasize deep RPG mechanics, story-driven gameplay, and character development

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
